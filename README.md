MUDdler is an engine for running and serving Multi User Dungeons. World creators need only craft the items, spells, character types and other basic definitions of the world. MUDdler takes your .world file and brings the virtual world to life.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile if you want to extend the core library and use it in another application:

```ruby
gem 'muddler'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it on the system manually if you want to run the built-in world server without wrapping it in another application:

    $ gem install muddler

## Usage

Currently, you can't really use things. Stay tuned.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, submit a PR to [github:eiwi1101/muddler](https://github.com/eiwi1101/muddler).
